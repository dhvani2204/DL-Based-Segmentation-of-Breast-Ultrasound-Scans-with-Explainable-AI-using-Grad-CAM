# DL-Based-Segmentation-of-Breast-Ultrasound-Scans-with-Explainable-AI-using-Grad-CAM

Medical image segmentation is essential for identifying the location and size of breast tumors in ultrasound scans. Traditional methods struggle in this task due to the complex and variable nature of the breast tissues. In this project, we have conducted a comparative study on deep learning based segmentation models like CNN, and Attention U-Net wherein our proposed techniques outperformed the traditional methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability showing promising results towards accurately segmenting the breast tumors. In addition to this we applied explainable AI-based Grad-CAM technique, which generated informative heat maps and feature importance scores, aiding experts’ understanding of the model’s decision-making process. Explainable AI techniques like Grad-CAM have the potential to positively impact early detection and ultimately enhance patient outcomes in breast cancer care.
